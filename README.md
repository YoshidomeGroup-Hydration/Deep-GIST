# Deep-GIST
====

"Deep GIST" is a deep-learning model rapidly estimating the distribution of hydration free energy around a protein obtained by the GIST. The computation is completed within a few minutes when using a single CPU and approximately one minute when using a single GPU.
Model weights (415 MB) are available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/XXXXXX)
